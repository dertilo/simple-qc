The dataset contains the following information:

    1. train_match_data.tsv: Each line contains 12 tab-separated question IDs. First ID is ID of question corresponding to that line, 2nd ID in the line is the ID of the semantically similar question to the corresponding question, rest of the 10 IDs belong 10 semantically dissimilar questions to the corresponding question. This data has been used to train the SVM classifier in our model.

    2. test_match_data.tsv: Each line contains 2 tab-separated question IDs. First ID is ID of question corresponding to that line, 2nd ID in the line is the ID of semantically similar question to the corresponding question. Data in this file was used as test data in our experiments.

    3. val_match data.tsv: Each line contains 2 tab-separated question IDs. First ID is ID of question corresponding to that line, 2nd ID in the line is the ID of semantically similar question to the corresponding question. Data in this file was used as validation/development data in our experiments.

    4. train_id_map.tsv: This file contains ID to question string map of all questions appearing in train_match_data.tsv file

    5. test_id_map.tsv: This file contains ID to question string map of all questions appearing in test_match_data.tsv file

    6. val_id_map.tsv: This file contains ID to question string map of all questions appearing in val_match_data.tsv file
	
	7. Question_Classification_Data.txt: This file contains the question associated with their taxonomy classes. The questions are in the following format "CoarseClass:FineClass Question"
	   The final classes (as described in the paper) are denoted with their initials two characters(initials of each word in case of multi-word).
